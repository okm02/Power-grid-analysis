\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

In scale-free networks (SF) the probability of a node being connected to $k$ others exhibits a power-law distribution $P(k) \propto k^{-\alpha}$, which is a topological property affecting and controlling their resilience or the measure of their functionality subject to disruptions \cite{Newman:2003da,Gao:2015fg,Bashan:2013cja,Gao:2015fga,2000Natur.406..378A}. Examples of this class of SF are the Internet, power systems, and transportations networks, which are real-world networks shown to be robust when subject to random failures however, display a high vulnerability when prone to cascading ones \cite{Bompard:2011cd,DuenasOsorio:2009ff,2016arXiv160904310M,Cohen:2001hf}. 

In power systems, and unlike random failures which emerge locally, blackouts are severe events  associated with cascading behavior leading to global network collapse \cite{RosasCasals:2007td,Bompard:2009ga,Brummitt:2013jj,Daqing:2014bp,Albert:2004bw,Wang:2011js,Sole:2008cv}.
Examples such as the one affecting the north-east in the US and eastern Canada in 2003 burdened their economies with 10 billions dollars of direct costs \cite{Daqing:2014bp}. Such failures can be linked to either structural dependencies, where the damage spreads via structurally dependent connections, or functional overloads, where the flow goes through alternative paths leading to overloaded nodes. Thus understanding the propagation of these failures becomes pivotal in developing and deploying protective and mitigating strategies. 

Large power systems and real-world networks in general exhibit an exponentially increasing combinatorial number of failure nodes. This levies an overwhelming computational burden that cannot be accomplished in real-time. In several leading works such as \cite{2000Natur.406..378A,JinAl10, DaqingAl14}, the power grid, particularly the network of its transmission lines, is analyzed using graph algorithms such as betweenness centrality and shortest paths. In this paper, we build on the approach in  \cite{2000Natur.406..378A} using an Apache Spark implementation of topological vulnerability analysis of the Lebanese power grid subject to random  and cascading failures. Beyond the scholarly aspects of our proposed work, our analysis contributes towards precision-based policy making and disaster response in a region marred by wars and under-development. 
%By targeted attacks, we do not merely allude to acts of aggression on power generating centers, but also to increasing consumption associated with a diminished national carrying capacity following the refugees influx. 
Using elements from distributed algorithm design, abstract data structures, as well as spatial analysis, our work extends the approach of \cite{2000Natur.406..378A} in analyzing the vulnerability of transmission lines to the assessment of that of the whole Lebanese power grid including its generation, distribution, and transmission lines. 

Our manuscript is organized as follows. In Sec. \ref{background}, we present an overview of related work that tackles power grid resilience analysis as well as implementations of it that runs on distributed systems, and we describe some intrinsics related to Apache spark for big data distributed processing. In Sec. \ref{methods}, we present our distributed graph algorithm that builds on the loosely centralized structure of the Lebanese power grid using Breadth First Search and Vertex Betweenness Centrality, orchestrated using four scenarios known in the literature \cite{2000Natur.406..378A}.
 Each of these scenarios simulates a unique temporal mode of removal of vertices.
  % sorted in a particular order (random or cascading failures): for example, nodes with the highest betweenness, nodes with the highest betweenness in cascading order resulting from their dynamical removal, the nodes with the highest loads, and random removals. 
 In Sec. \ref{results}, we perform run-time analysis of our algorithm and obtain excellent scalability as the number of processing cores increases up to 32, a result which we attribute to the large number of SCCs found in the Lebanese power grid and the fact that majority of SCCs have a relatively small cardinality. We demonstrate the loss in connectivity in the power grid associated with each scenario. We also perform a spatial correlation analysis of failures using the geocoding of vertices that have led substantial loss in connectivity. In Sec. \ref{conclusion}, we conclude with remarks around the impact of our work.%, particularly, as it relates to directing policy making. should current trends of refugee influx continue. It is our hope that our work can help answer questions such as: what factors will affect future observations at different locations on Lebanese soil? and what can be done to better manage our dwindling vital systems?
