Contingency analysis is a security function to assess the ability of a power grid to sustain various combinations of power grid component failures at energy control centers. To date, there exists no such work to examine the power grid resilience in Lebanon, a country which is still reeling under the effect of a brutal civil war, and recently, bearing an additional burden associated with the spillover from the Syrian war. This neighbouring conflict has exposed Lebanon to a number of random terrorist attacks, and caused it to become one of the major hosts of Syrian refugees, in addition to Iraqi and Palestinian refugees in former years. The strains on Lebanon's vital infrastructure have also been affecting the host community itself, where electric power supply is becoming increasingly drained. Coupled with a severe shortage of funds that can help restructure the entire system, the Lebanese power grid has become plagued with nationwide blackouts, making it an unreliable source of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.
