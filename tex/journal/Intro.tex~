\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

Contingency analysis is a security function to assess the ability of a power grid to sustain various combinations of power grid component failures at energy control centers. To date, there exists no such work to examine the power grid resilience in Lebanon, a country which is still reeling under the effect of a brutal civil war, and recently, bearing an additional burden associated with the spillover from the Syrian war. This neighbouring conflict has exposed Lebanon to a number of random terrorist attacks, and caused it to become one of the major hosts of Syrian refugees, in addition to, formerly, Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. The strains on Lebanon's vital infrastructure have also been affecting the host community itself, where electric power supply is becoming increasingly drained. Coupled with a severe shortage of funds that can help restructure the entire system, the Lebanese power grid has become plagued with nationwide blackouts, making it an unreliable source of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. 

In this paper, we investigate the reliability and robustness of the Lebanese power grid in the hope that this will contribute towards more precision for policy making, and provide for an evidence-based simulation of the system's degradation in the event of attacks. By attacks, we do not merely allude to acts of aggression on energy centers, but also to strains associated with a diminished national carrying capacity following the refugees influx. Our approach combines elements from Graph Theory, distributed computing, and geospatial analysis, all adapted for the peculiarities of the Lebanese setting, and bolstered using big data distributed processing techniques that allows this study to scale to networks of similar topology. Our contributions can be summarised as follows: (1) a temporal understanding of the chronology by which energy centers can be exposed and are at risk, (2) a spatial understanding of the hotspots on Lebanese soil where energy centers can be exposed and are at risk, (3) a structural understanding of the Lebanese power grid that reveals a certain level of decentralisation, which, surprisingly, may be percevied as a sign of modest resilience braving huge strains (4) a fully automated graph transformation of such analysis hinging on strongly connected components (SCCs) that scales with big data using Apache Spark, the leading platform for big data processing, and (5) the possibility to exploit the structural patterns revealed in the Lebanese power grid in order to study the resilience of all of the networks associated with it, such as communications network, banking systems networks, Internet networks, transportation networks, hospitals and medical centers networks, ...etc.

Our manuscript is organised as follows. In Sec. \ref{background}, we present an overview of related work that tackles power grid resilience analysis as well as implementations of it that runs on distributed systems, and we describe some intrinsics related to Apache spark for big data distributed processing. In Sec. \ref{methods}, we present our distributed graph algorithm that builds on the loosely centralised structure of the Lebanese power grid using Breadth First Search and Vertex Betweenness Centrality, orchestrated using four scenarios known in the literature (for example, see \cite{2000Natur.406..378A} out of many). Each of these scenarios simulates a unique temporal mode of attack on (removal of) vertices sorted in a particular order (random or cascading failures): for example, nodes with the highest betweenness, nodes with the highest betweenness in cascading order resulting from their dynamical removal, the nodes with the highest loads, and random removals. In Sec. \ref{results}, we perform run-time analysis of our algorithm and obtain excellent scalability as the number of processing cores increases up to 32, a result which we attribute to the large number of SCCs found in the Lebanese power grid and the fact that majority of SCCs have a very small size. We demonstrate the loss in connectivity in the power grid associated with each scenario, where we find? We also perform a spatial correlation analysis of cascading failures using the geocoding of vertices that have led substantial loss in connectivity in each of the first three scenarios undertaken. There we find? In Sec. \ref{conclusion}, we conclude with remarks around the impact of our work, particularly, as it relates to policy making if current trends of refugee influx continue. what factors will affect future observations at different locations? What can be done to result in a wanted change, or to better manage the system?
