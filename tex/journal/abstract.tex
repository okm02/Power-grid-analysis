\begin{abstract} We begin by developing a global structural understanding of the Lebanese power grid that reveals a certain level of decentralization via numerous strongly connected components.
Then, using Apache Spark, we address its topological vulnerability  subject to random and cascading failures  by which energy centers in Lebanon can be exposed and are at risk. Subsequently, a spatial analysis of the failures is presentend. Our Spark implementation achieves significant speedup on ? cores and concludes in real time for a graph with about $800,000$ nodes. The amenability of our work to big data processing makes it extendable to larger networks of networks, towards a fuller understanding of resilience at many vital levels beyond the power grid.
