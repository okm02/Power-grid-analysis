THIS IS APPEARING IN THE TEXT AS IS. I SUGGEST WE REWRITE IT.We present an Apache Spark implementation of topological vulnerability analysis of the Lebanese power grid subject to random and cascading failures. Using elements from distributed algorithm design, abstract data structures, as well as spatial analysis, our work extends the approach of \cite{2000Natur.406..378A} in mapping the topology of complex networks, and adapts it to the peculiarities of the Lebanese power grid. We begin by developing a global structural understanding of the Lebanese power grid that reveals a certain level of decentralisation via numerous strongly connected components. We further develop an Apache Spark implementation that simulates random and cascading sequences of events by which energy centers in Lebanon can be exposed and are at risk. This implementation concludes in real-time for the entire power grid, achieving a speed-up of ? on ? processors. We conclude with a spatial understanding of the hotspots on Lebanese soil where energy centers can be exposed and are at risk, using a spatial correlation kernel supported by a binary search tree. The amenability of our work to big data processing makes it extendable to larger networks of networks, towards a fuller understanding of resilence at many vital levels beyond the power grid.
