In this paper, we present a topological vulnerability analysis of the Lebanese power grid subject to random failures and targeted attacks using elements from Graph Theory, distributed computing, and geospatial analysis, all adapted for the peculiarities of the Lebanese setting. Our results deliver all of the following: (1) a temporal understanding of the chronology by which energy centers can be exposed and are at risk, (2) a spatial understanding of the hotspots on Lebanese soil where energy centers can be exposed and are at risk, (3) a structural understanding of the Lebanese power grid that reveals a certain level of decentralisation, which, surprisingly, may be percevied as a sign of modest resilience braving huge strains (4) a fully automated graph transformation of such analysis hinging on strongly connected components (SCCs) that scales with big data using Apache Spark, the leading platform for big data processing, and (5) the possibility to exploit the structural patterns revealed in the Lebanese power grid in order to study the resilience of all of the networks associated with it.
