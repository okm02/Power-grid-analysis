\begin{itemize}
\item The paper has improved by addressing most of the previous comments. However, the presented arguments are not yet convincing as why Spark platform is necessary in the presented analysis. Spark is in the title of the manuscript so this suggests the importance of the role of Spark in the analysis but based on the rest of the paper the use of Spark is not well-motivated and justified. Merely having the capability to use Spark to show that the analysis can be extend is not enough as the presented analysis can be done without Spark in a single computer. I would suggest either tone down the role of Spark or better justify its importance. The importance aspect of this study is the vulnerability analysis and not on what platform it was done, unless one couldn't do this without Spark. As such, the contribution and main focus of the paper needs to be clarified.
